# Day 2

## Platforms

- DevOps is everything you do to **overcome the friction between silos**. Everything else is plain engineering.
- Frictions:
  - **Cultural**: different ways of behaving
  - **Operational**: different ways of working
  - **Cognitive**: different ways of thinking
- -> Platform as a product is the key pattern to "overcome the friction between silos".
- Platforms State of the Union
  - Things going well with platforms
    - Focus on user experience (DevEx)
    - A successful way to manage cognitive load on stream-aligned teams
    - (Some) product experience
  - Missing for getting platforms right:
    - Platform boundaries need to be more fluid -> Rigid platform boundaries block teams and increase cognitive load.
    - Need to be more mindful of cognitive load on platform teams.
      - Be realistic about capacity & organize around streams of value inside the platform(s)
      - Tool they develop to measure cognitive load and are soon releasing: https://www.teamperature.com/
    - Platform org design & comms need to tbe optimized for high trust.
      - Trust is the preferred currency for platform adoption.
- Going on to say that orgs can adopt platform approaches in non-engineering teams:
  - Compliance and Legal examples
  - Leadership as a Platform example:
    - Strategy boards service
    - Metrics service
    - Those teach people what they should be looking at to lead themselves.
- "It's not autonomy doing what you want, it's agency to operate with safety "
- Principles:
  1. Prioritize fast flow of value to (end) customers.
  2. Focus on unblocking other through (curated) self-service platforms.
  3. Our platform is open to change, collaborate to discover new needs.
  4. Optimize for adoption and discoverability.
  5. Enable others by meeting them where they are today.
- Platform Manifesto
  - **teams & interactions** over tools & functionality
  - **adaptions & engagement** over mandates & standards
  - **rich dev ex** over technical prowess
  - **open to change and collaborate** to discover needs unblocking internal customer via self-service patterns

# Capacity is not unlimited

- Capacity planning tales by elastic with 50k deployments of varies sizes
- Problems:
  - Tight instance type coupling
  - Instance removed but no replacement because type is out of capacity
- Do capacity reservations
  - Probe for capacity
  - Start using future capacity reservations
  - Plan availability zones support
  - Project/Plan/Reserve
  - Design for flexibility

# Cloud Development Environment - CDE

- Pros
  - We can address the BYOD problem with CDEs
  - Onboarding much faster
  - Transfer much faster
  - Secure Cloud Development also provides a secure browser.
- Cons
  - Less customizability for devs
  - Very limited number of IDEs
  - Need Internet to write code
  - Large point of failure
  - A lot of Maintenance
  - Cost?
- Decision drivers:
  - DevEx
  - DevOps Productivity
  - Asset utilization and cost governance
  - Data security policies
  - Data access control
